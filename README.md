# RPTA
Role Playing Text Adventure

I've been wanting to make a text adventure since I learned to code in 2019, and I think I finally have the skills to
do it (fingers crossed). I'm going for some advanced TA mechanics with RPG style elements like battle mechanics and
shops, etc.

The short term goal is to make a game while writing loosely coupled, extendable code so that I can eventually (long term
goal) build an RPTA maker that works with the game engine I'm working on now.
